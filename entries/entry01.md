## Overview / Sources

This is my first blog entry for my freedom project, and I will be learning and utilizing <b>Swift</b>. This is a general-purpose computer language developed by Apple Inc. tailored for IOS application development. My project, which will be known as *"The Programmers Notebook"*, will be a note-taking application for programmers, developers, and students. I have yet to find an application dedicated to note-taking with code development in mind. So that was the inspiration for my project, developing a note-taking app with developers in mind. A local IOS note taking application for users to take notes in with features such as ```code blocks```, and *Proper Code Etiquette Formate*.  

So far I have been doing a simple review and absorption of the language through Bootcamp videos learning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ulp1Kimblg0">fundementals</a>. Basics and simple programs, so far I am very excited to start working with this language as it seems simple to pick up. I also really how heavily it leans into graphical designs.  

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

The Engineering Design Process (EDP) is a <b>7-step process of *planning, designing, creating, testing, and then improving on*</b>. Therefore, the process doesn't end as there are always ways to improve upon your design. Improvements that can be done through testing and user feedback, both I plan on hosting. To begin I have to recognize the problem, lack of programmer-focused note applications. First I have to understand what makes a note-taking app a *note-taking app*. Going past the bare bones of taking in and saving user inputs it is important to make the process as easy for the user. Note-taking on your phone should be just as easy as putting pencil to paper. Currently I am at stage 1, planning. My project, *"The Programmers Notebook"*, ambitiously speaking will have the quality of life features to make note-taking easier and more code-friendly. But in a Minimal Viable Product sense, I first need to just create a program that takes in a user input, saves and stores them, then pull them from the local device whenever. 
 
After I have that I can countinue this passion project and leave something behind the next generation of coders at my Highschool can utilize fully. 
 
## Knowledge

As of right now, I am just beginning. Due to college and family responsibilities, I haven't been able to do a deep dive. I do know <b>Swfit</b> leans heavily into the graphical design. On first impression, it seems very noobie friendly. Something I half-expected as it was developed by Apple Inc. 

## Skills

Skills that I have to lean on are <b>Priotization</b> and <b>Research.</b>

I have a lot to do and something I learned is that priority matters. Prioritizing when to do work and when to relax is very important in maintaining a healthy balance. I also have to make sure I research efficiently when I do work. This is so I can get the most out of my time and also absorb the information properly.
