# Entry 2
##### 12/9/21

## Overview / Sources

In my previous entry, I went over <b>Swift</b>. <b>Swift</b> is a general-purpose computer language developed and marketed by Apple Inc. This computer language is tailored for iOS application development. I briefly went over what my app will do and some outlines. In this entry, I will go more in-depth where I want to go with this project, "The Programmer Notebook". The focus for this project will be for it to be developer or programmer-focused. I have yet to come across a note-taking app that genuinely is for developers and is not a cash grab or was made with developers in mind but with little research or understanding of the field. My vision for this application is that it will open to change. I want a dedicated formula for input and change, have users be able to utilize features they want and turn off ones they don't want. Give users the freedom of changing to different versions if they have a preference or even code in their preferences if they want. Similar to Wikipedia where everyone can freely share and use.

<b>Potential Basic Features</b>
<li>Code Blocks</li>
<li>Code Proofreading</li>
<li>In Text Notes</li>




## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

The Engineering Design Process (EDP) is a <b>7-step process of *planning, designing, creating, testing, and then improving on*</b>. Therefore, the process doesn't end as there are always ways to improve upon your design. Improvements that can be done through testing and user feedback, both I plan on hosting. To begin I have to recognize the problem, lack of programmer-focused note applications. First I have to understand what makes a note-taking app a *note-taking app*. Going past the bare bones of taking in and saving user inputs it is important to make the process as easy for the user. Note-taking on your phone should be just as easy as putting pencil to paper. Currently I am at stage 2, testing. My project, *"The Programmers Notebook"*, ambitiously speaking will have the quality of life features to make note-taking easier and more code-friendly. But in a Minimal Viable Product sense, I first need to just create a program that takes in a user input, saves and stores them, then pull them from the local device whenever. 
 
After I have that I can countinue this passion project and leave something behind the next generation of coders at my Highschool can utilize fully. 
 
## Knowledge/ Goals

This upcoming winter break I plan to fully dive into learning <b>Swift</b> with the extra time I have. After first impressions, I see that <b>Swift</b> is user-friendly but this does not mean you can just jump in. It does a lot to make coding streamlined and straightforward but knowing what you are doing can make this process extremely easy. I have compiled a small playlist with resources to learn <b>Swfit</b>.
