### MVP
"MVP" Stands for "Minimal Viable Product". Have a project that works as intended and does the basic functionality. For my note app, this MVP would be an application that can take notes, this means taking in data and storing it to be opened again. That is the bare bones functionally that is needed to work. Here you can see my MVP done in its final stage.

 To further elaborate on what I explained in my previous entry, these classes connect to the storyboard. On the storyboard, I can apply and connect these classes + functions to certain objects. This is for the Note Entry portion of the note app.

 This is a func. that resides in the class previously mentioned. This is the func. for adding a new note to the table. This snippet connects the ViewController to the EntryViewController. When it is run it switches screens or the 'view' to the EntryView. Since this code is linked to an 'add' button it is only run when that button is clicked.

### EDP 

I am currently in the last stages of the engineering design process. Creating and improving on what I have now, my MVP. From here I have bare-bones functionality. Now I add on and build upon that. Improving and expanding the functionalities of the app. 

### Skills 

#### Time Management 
With college admissions and school, I have a lot on my plate, definitely more than I am used to. 
Because of that Time Management has become very important between balancing my FP and outside school priorities. 

#### Agency 
Due to the nature of the FP using my own agency to find ways to learn how to use Swift and Xcode are prevalent. Google and Youtube have been great resources as well as the Apple Swift documentation.
