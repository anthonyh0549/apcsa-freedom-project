### MVP
"MVP" Stands for "Minimal Viable Product". This means to have a project that works as intended and does the basic functionality. For my note app, this MVP would be an application that can take notes, this means taking in data and storing it to be opened again. That is the bare bones functionally that is needed to work. Here you can see my MVP done in its final stage with some minor audits.

 ### Elevator Pitch   
 
An elevator pitch is a short description of an idea that explains the concept in a way such that any listener can understand it in a short period of time.
 
One of the main takwaways for me was communicating my MVP to other people who may not be as tech savy. It was very hard to not go into technical detail of my project and keep it short. Definitely a grow for me is making my "elevator pitch" more concise and more digestible.   
### Presentation  

The main grow for me in terms of presentation I think is illustrating my product better, I definitely could have also pratice more in terms of the technical parts of my presentation such as utilizing my own laptop. There was long pauses in my presentation due to things loading or just not showing properly. Having more control over the flow would have done me much better.

### EDP

I am currently done, at least in regard to work in class. Now I am in a stage of relfection and seeing ways to add on more. Seeing what I could've done better and so forth. 

### Skills 



#### Time Management 
Being concise and clear during my presentation is very important, not taking too long on a slide is important to retain my audience. 

#### Agency 
Due to the nature of demonstrating my FP,I should've used my own agency to better control the flow of my demostration
